So materials, maybe? Why not?
=====================
Well we've learned a bit about variables and variable types that are used in C++. Here you can find a bit more additional information about them.
* [variables and variable types](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/)
* [variable types memory usage and sizeof function](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_types.htm)
check this it's something that I forgot to mention. It's useful and important for the course.

So we've also talked about boolean expressions. What are they, why do we use them and so on. Basically in these materials you can find again some more knowledge about them.
* [basic boolean expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VveLH3m6cfA)
* [compound boolean expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHNG4ODjrd8)

And of course something about C++ libraries. In that [list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) are mentioned a lot of them. Maybe the most useful once.
