##Task 1 Awesome Point

Write a program which asks the user to enter the coordinates of a point (x,y). Using the user input the program should tell the user if this point is awesome or not. What makes a point awesome? The point should be contained by the figure showed below.

Example usage

 * Input:
	```
	x=2, y=2
	```
	Outpu:
	```
	The point is awesome!
	```
 *  Input:
	```
	x=-2, y=-1
	```
	Outpu:
	```
	The point is awesome!
	```
 * Input:
	```
	x=-2, y=-1.3
	```
	Outpu:
	```
	The point isn't awesome!
	```
 * Input:
	```
	x=2, y=-1
	```
	Outpu:
	```
	The point is awesome!
	```
Unfortunately you're going to need some math for that task.

##Task 2 Math Functions

Write a C++, which uses the cmath library as follows:
 * computes and displays the square of a number
 * computes and displays the square root of a number
 * finds and displays the absolute value of a number
 * rounds a rational number and displays the result
 * finds the biggest element

###Good luck!
