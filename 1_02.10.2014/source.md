*Here you can find a more detailed explaination of the difference between a compiler and interpreter

*In the link bellow you can find the scheme of how a c++ program is actually being built, as well as some additional materials for the preprocessor's directives.

*If you're curious how long the code of the c++ Hello World is or you just want to check something in the code, do not hasitate and check hello_world.cpp.
