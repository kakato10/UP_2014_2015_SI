Time to choose (if, if/else, switch)
=====================
Great, you've learned some of the basics of the C++ language, now it's time to see how do we navigate our programs to go in different directions, depending on some kind of conditions. So here are your tasks for this exercise.
This time, read the tasks careful

##Task 1 Triangles are cool!
Write a C++ program, which asks the user to enter three numbers a,b and c and validates the user input. The program should tell the user if they form a triangle or no. (use only if statements not if/else)
 * Input:
	```
	a = 1, b = 2, c = 2
	```
	Output:
	```
	Great we've formed a triangle!!
	```
 *  Input:
	```
	a = 1.3, b = 4, c = -1 
	```
	Output:
	```
	Seriously?! Why didn't you enter positive numbers? Is it that hard?
	```
 *  Input:
	```
	a = 1, b = 1, c = 2 
	```
	Output:
	```
	Nope there's no triangle with this  values for sides!
	```


##Task 2 "I am ROOT!!"

Write a C++ program which asks the user to enter three numbers a,b and c. After that your program should solve the quadratic equation which is constructed from them (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). You should handle all possible outcomes.

Example usage

 * Input:
	```
	a = 1, b = 2, c = 1
	```
	Output:
	```
	x1 = x2 = -1
	```
 *  Input:
	```
	a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 
	```
	Output:
	```
	No roots that are real numbers! 
	```
 * Input:
	```
	a = 1, b = 4, c = 0
	```
	Output:
	```
	x1 = 0, x2 = -4
	```

##Task 3 Simple Calculator

Write a C++, which asks the user to enter three values for a, operator and b, where a and b are numbers and operator is char. Operator should be one of the following: '+', '-', '/', '*'
So basically you should display the value of  "a operator b" using switch. If the operator is not one of these four it should display the message "Unknown operator!". The examples are going to make it a bit more understandable.
 * Input:
	```
	a = 4, operator = '+',  b = 3.2
	```
	Output:
	```
	7.2
	```
 *  Input:
	```
	a = 4, operator = '/', b = 2 
	```
	Output:
	```
	2
	```
 * Input:
	```
	a = 3, operator = '*', b = 2
	```
	Output:
	```
	6
	```

 * Input:
	```
	a = 3, operator = '%', b = 2
	```
	Output:
	```
	Unknown operator!!
	```

### Now that you've read everything, get to work. 
## Let the force be with you!
