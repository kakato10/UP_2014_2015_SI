Enum and arrays
=====================

##Task 1: Show me the week!
Write a C++ programm which uses an enum type called Weekdays. The programm should ask the user to enter a weekday. Check if he wants to trick you. If no display all the days that are left from the week.

Example:
Input
```
Eneter a weekday: 4
```
Output
```
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
```

##Task 2: "I am in relationship!!!!!"
Write a C++ program which asks the user to enter a number. Then the user should enter 7 more numbers that should fill an array of 7 elements. When the whole entering of numbers is over the program should display all numbers from the array that are in relation with the first one.
The rule is: aRb <=> the sum of the squares of a and b are bigger than 40 and b is odd. 

Example:
Input
```
first_number = 5
numbers[0] = 1
numbers[1] = -1
numbers[2] = 4
numbers[3] = 7
numbers[4] = 3
numbers[5] = 19
numbers[6] = -4
```
Output
```
5 is in relation with 7
5 is in relation with 19
```
