Materials
=====================

So now it's time for a little bit of additional materials, that you can use.


* a [presentation][https://www.google.bg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CDgQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.math-cs.gordon.edu%2Fcourses%2Fcps212%2Fpaperwork%2FJava-C%252B%252Bcomparison.pdf&ei=kMY-VLjkNujnygOPyYKIBA&usg=AFQjCNHhUJm9HmaD7_JVU88ipIsrMmuKnA&sig2=KSiJ-UZkDHliUhIKWpwdsg], which can be considered as a summary of what you have learned already

* http://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/ref/cpp_keywords.html - more info about reserved words and standard words (in the material they are called "predefined identifiers")

* http://www.ntchosting.com/encyclopedia/scripting-and-programming/script/ - an interesting article about scirps, which explains why do we need them and where can we actually use them

That's for now. 
Wish you a pleasent reading!
