Materials
=====================

So now it's time for a little bit of additional materials, that you can use.


* a [presentation](http://www.letu.edu/people/stevearmstrong/COSC%201303/NellDale%20Lectures/chapter%202.ppt), which can be considered as a summary of what you have learned already

* http://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/ref/cpp_keywords.html - more info about reserved words and standard words (in the material they are called "predefined identifiers")

* http://www.ntchosting.com/encyclopedia/scripting-and-programming/script/ - an interesting article about scirps, which explains why do we need them and where can we actually use them

That's for now. 
Wish you a pleasent reading!
